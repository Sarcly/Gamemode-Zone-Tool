# The making of zones and their catagories
- Catagory structures where each cat has a global function that all zones that are in that cat will run every frame
- catagories can have sub catagories that have their own global function that run along side all parent catagory functions
- Gamemode will be able to define non overridable functions for catagories
- Gamemode it REQUIRED to define a file of \<gamemode name\>.json with definitions of all catagories required for gamemode to work

# Adding zones to catagories
- snap to edges

# Things zones should be able to do
- Make a face solid or all faces solid
- set a texture on a face
- set what events it fire
- show direction overlay
- other things i cant think of rn lol
